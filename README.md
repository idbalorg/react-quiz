possible improvements

1. select difficulty level by number of question or through timing
2. upload result to a fake api the highscore can be reloaded and placed back in the state
3. answers can be stored in an array so answers can be reviewd after the completion of the test


# Challenge: Create advanced state management system with useReducer + Context API

üë®‚Äçüíº You have been tasked by your project manager to refactor this app to using the Context API

YOUR TASKS:

- Duplicate `src` folder to `src-no-context`
- Review data flow and passed props
- Identify prop drilling problem
- Use the Context API to fix the (very small) prop drilling problem
- Create a new context `QuizContext` with the reducer we created earlier
- Create a custom provider component `QuizProvider` and provide all the state to the app
- Create a custom hook to consume state all over the application
- Delete all unnecessary props
- IMPORTANT: Note how you actually need state right in App component. This means you need to wrap the whole App into the context (HINT: try in index.js)
